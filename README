TEMPORARY README:
---
Before launching "build-image.sh" you must build Android (AOSP or CyanogenMod)!
Than make a new folder in your device directory

	$ mkdir ...AOSP/device/amlogic/tm809/NEWFOLDER

copy "build-image.sh", "build-uImage_recovery.sh", "mkimage"
copy vendor "uImage" (same version of "update.zip")
copy vendor "uImage_recovey" (work only with V0629.20-C_CH@20110719)
from " http://www.ainol.com/plugin.php?identifier=ainol&module=download&action=info&downloadid=66 "
launch
	$ ./build-image.sh
	$ ./build-image_recovery.sh

will make two new folders in AOSP out directory with new
"uImage" "boot.img" "uImage_recovey" "aml_autoscript"
