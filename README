Before launching this scripts you must build Android (AOSP or CyanogenMod)!
Than copy "uImage_builder" folder in your device directory

	$ ...AOSP/device/amlogic/YOUR-DEVICE/uImage_builder

	$ cd uImage_builder
	$ ./build-image.sh YOUR-DEVICE
	$ ./build-image_recovery.sh YOUR-DEVICE


			EX:

will make two new folders in AOSP out directory with new
"uImage" "boot.img" "uImage_recovey" "aml_autoscript"
