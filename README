TEMPORARY README:

Before launching "build-image.sh" you must build Android (AOSP/CyanogenMod)!

Than make a new folder in your device directory in AOSP
	$ mkdir ...AOSP/device/amlogic/aml8726m/NEWDIR
copy "build-image.sh", "amltxtscript", "mkimage"
copy vendor "uImage", "uImage_recovey" (preferred V0629.20-C_CH@20110719)
from " http://www.ainol.com/plugin.php?identifier=ainol&module=download&action=info&downloadid=66 "

launch
	$ ./build-image.sh
will make a new folder in AOSP out directory with new
"uImage" "boot.img" "uImage_recovey" "aml_autoscript"
